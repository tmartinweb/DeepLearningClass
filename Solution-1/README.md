Write brief explanation here:

Hello!!

I used main.py for a 'line break' constant, a 'opening' console print, and as driver code for each problem.

Each problem has its own .py file (problem_1.py), and can be run together via main.py, or commented out to run one-at-a-time.

I also added some input scrubbing and such to reduce errors from user input.

Fun review assignment!
